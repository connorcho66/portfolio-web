                Hi everyone, my name is Connor Cho. I was born in Korea and moved to US in 2009. 
                I lived in Philly since I came to US. I graduated culinary school and worked in kitchen for few years, 
                but I decide to change my career and few of my friend told me about coding and I did some research about Bootcamp and decided to join. 
                I can't wait to start Bootcamp and learn new things. 
                My goal that I'm looking for is to have solid knowledge in the field and have stable career that I can enjoy. 
                I can play acoustic and electric guitar and cello. I played cello since 4th grade and played in orchestra in high school but after 
                I graduated high school quit playing cello and moved to guitar. 
                I just play guitar for fun and didn't have proper lessons from other but I enjoy them in spare time
            </p>
