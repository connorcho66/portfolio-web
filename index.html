                Hi everyone, my name is Connor Cho. I was born in Korea and moved to US in 2009. 
                I lived in Philly since I came to US. I graduated culinary school and worked in kitchen for few years, 
                but I decide to change my career because working as a chef, I didn't really have personal time. Although I'm not working in the kitchen,
                I love to cook and make dessert from time to time. Also, I love brewing coffee so I love trying out differnt beans from differnt roaster from the state.
                After I started to brew coffee, brewing coffee has become daily routine in the mornging. By doing this, it wakes me up and it's very relaxing.
                <br><br>Reason why I jumped into software developer field is because some of my friends that are in this field, recommended me to give it a try. So I started with Python
                by watching YouTube videos and solving some problems that are online. I enjoyed that time and decide to go this path.
                Goal that I'm aiming for is to have solid knowledge in the field and have stable career that I can enjoy. I am eager to learn more about software engineering.
            </p>
